# # Climate Change Prediction for Armenia

## Overview

This project aims to predict climate change trends in Armenia using time series analysis. The analysis involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), checking for stationarity, and applying an ARIMA model to make predictions.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Data Exploration:**
  - Analyzed historical climate data for Armenia.
  - Identified key variables and trends.
  
- **Visualization:**
  - Utilized visualizations to illustrate patterns and anomalies.
  - Plotted time series graphs for temperature, precipitation, etc.

### Stationarity Check

- **Stationarity Analysis:**
  - Checked stationarity of the time series data.
  - Applied techniques such as rolling statistics and Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.

### ARIMA Model

- **Modeling:**
  - Applied AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.
  - Tuned model parameters based on stationarity results.
